Some say that reading newspapers and watching TV news is a waste of time, because it has no direct connection with people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In the digital era, there is a growing belief that newspapers and TV news are outdated since these traditional news sources have no direct relevance to people’s personal lives. I, however, disagree with this perspective as it overlooks the broader role of news in shaping an informed society.
It is crucial to understand that all forms of news offer useful insights into events that add to our overall understanding of the world. This awareness helps people to develop a more profound insight into the world beyond their own country. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, individuals need to be aware of global newsworthy situations as actions in one part of the globe can quickly cause ripple effects elsewhere. For example, during the Brexit negotiations, comprehensive news reports helped people worldwide understand the economic and political ramifications, not just for the UK and Europe, but for global trade and travel.
Another important point to consider is that news media act as watchdogs that hold those in power accountable. By reporting on government policies, societal issues, and public opinions, newspapers and TV news ensure that citizens are well-informed, which is essential for making responsible voting decisions. While it is true that the immediacy of social media and the internet might provide more direct engagement with our immediate interests, it would be a mistake to dismiss traditional news sources as outdated and irrelevant. Newspapers and TV news offer a broader, more in-depth perspective on the world, which is invaluable for developing a well-rounded worldview.
In conclusion, while newspapers and TV news might not always have a direct influence our personal daily experiences, their contribution to our understanding of the broader world, democracy, and social issues is significant. Dismissing them as a waste of time, in my view, overlooks the essential role they play in creating and shaping an informed society.

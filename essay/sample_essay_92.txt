People in senior positions should be compensated with significantly higher salaries than people in lower positions in the same company. Do you agree or disagree? 
Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.
Compensation is a critical element in employee performance and retention. Senior positions in companies often come with higher salaries, but the extent of this gap has been a source of debate. While some argue that senior executives should be given significantly higher salaries than their lower-level colleagues, others believe in creating a more equitable compensation system that values employee contributions irrespective of their rank in the company. In my opinion, rather than a rank or title, compensation should be based on the value that a person delivers to the organisation.
One argument for compensating senior executives with higher salaries is that they carry more significant responsibilities and accountability than lower-level employees. Moreover, senior executives have often accrued years of experience and developed a unique set of skills that are not found in lower-level employees, which again supports compensation based on the seniority of employees in the company. In many companies there are managers who worked their way up and have contributed many years until they were promoted to the positions they are currently in; it is reasonable that they earn more than junior employees who are just starting out.
On the other hand, there are those who believe that excessive compensation gaps lead to inequality and can cause lower-level employees to lose morale and productivity. While it is true that senior executives carry a larger load of responsibilities, massive gaps in compensation can lead to resentment and dissatisfaction among the workforce. Furthermore, lower-level employees are often the ones responsible for the day-to-day operations of a company, which means that they contribute to the companyâ€™s overall success, and therefore, they should also receive fair compensation.
To conclude, there are compelling arguments for both sides of the compensation debate. Senior executives should be compensated fairly for the unique skills and increased responsibilities that come with their position, and to attract top-level talent to companies. However, this does not mean that lower-level employees should be denied the opportunity to earn a fair wage. Compensation, therefore, should be based on the value that an employee brings to the organization, rather than their rank or title.

This essay topic was seen in recent IELTS test in India.
Some people believe that countries should produce all the food necessary to feed their populations and import as little food as possible. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In recent years the topic of food sovereignty has become a pressing issue for many nations. It is a commonly held belief that that countries should prioritise being self-sufficient by producing all the food necessary for their citizens instead of importing it.  Although this viewpoint has its merits, I believe that this is not a feasible or beneficial option.
To begin, utilising local food production will enhance a country’s national security, as this will prevent international disputes that may occur over pricing and other financial issues related to importing goods, such as taxes and other costs. In addition, local food production will promote sustainable agricultural practices according to a country’s regional climates, which will preserve local biodiversity.
However, it must be noted that this method might not be beneficial for all nations, as not every country possesses arable land or a climate that is conducive to cultivating a variety of produce. For example, countries in colder parts of the world would not have access to tropical fruits like mangoes or bananas. Therefore, importing food is vital to provide a variety of food items as well an ensuring that certain items are available even during off seasons or other times of shortage. I also believe that being exposed to food items from other countries can add to our cultural diversity and enrich our culinary experiences.
In conclusion, while it might be beneficial for some nations to strive for food self-sufficiency, for many others this approach is unrealistic and could deprive a large part of the world of the broader benefits of global trade. Therefore, a balanced combination of domestic production and imports would be a more suitable option.

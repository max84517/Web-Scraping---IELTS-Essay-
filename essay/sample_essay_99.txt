Sample Band 8 Essay
In this day and age, a large number of nations are grappling with the phenomenon that younger generations no longer communicate as frequently with their elders as they used to. There are various reasons why this situation has arisen and several solutions can be implemented in order to improve it.
Firstly, one of the main factors causing this communication gap between young people and older generations is the ever-increasing technology usage among young generations. Many young people spend their time on devices like computers, smartphones or tablets, which provide them with platforms for social interaction without real-life physical contact or communication with other people. Older people, on the other hand, prefer the old-fashioned ways to communicate, which means there are fewer opportunities for contact between the generations.
Another possible reason behind the lack of communication among members of different age groups is the cultural values that have been instilled throughout history; for instance, in many countries, children are taught from an early age to respect and obey their elders without questioning them. As a result, when younger generations become adults, they may find it difficult to have meaningful conversations with older people where opinions can be freely shared and discussed.
In order to improve this situation several steps can be taken. For example, schools can incorporate classes focusing on inter-generational dialogue so that students could learn how to communicate effectively across all ages by discussing topics such as politics or culture in a respectful manner. Additionally, families could encourage younger members of the family to spend more time talking with their grandparents and uncles/aunts, either in person or on the phone, instead of just spending their free time online. This could help create stronger bonds between different generations within a family.
To sum up, it is clear that raising awareness about this issue is key, since it carries significant implications for our society’s future development if left unresolved. Thus, everyone should take action towards promoting inter-generational dialogues so that our young and old can learn from each other’s experiences and create better connections within our societies moving forward.
